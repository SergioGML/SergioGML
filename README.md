ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SergioGML
ğŸ‘€ My interests are very diverse (and generally inexpensive). I enjoy exercising, being in nature,animals,gardening, reading a good book, playing entertaining games, and spending time with my loved ones.
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning several things. I am solidifying my JavaScript foundations and making the most of my knowledge in HTML and CSS, but I have a lot to refine. "Little by little, I will achieve it."
