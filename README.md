👋 Hi, I’m @SergioGML
👀 My interests are very diverse (and generally inexpensive). I enjoy exercising, being in nature,animals,gardening, reading a good book, playing entertaining games, and spending time with my loved ones.
🌱 I’m currently learning several things. I am solidifying my JavaScript foundations and making the most of my knowledge in HTML and CSS, but I have a lot to refine. "Little by little, I will achieve it."
💞️ At the moment, I'm not looking to collaborate on anything, just to learn as much as possible about these new technologies.
📫 How to reach me: [sergiogarciamanzanares@gmail.com]
⚡ Previously, I was a video editor and Motion Graphics designer for 8 years, so I have a lot of experience with the Adobe suite (Premiere, After Effects, Photoshop) and have developed the aesthetic side; now I need to solidify the logical side!
